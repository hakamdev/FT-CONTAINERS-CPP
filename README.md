# FT::CONTAINERS (C++)
  This project is a re-implementation of some C++ containers, namely, <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::map</code> and <code>std::stack</code>.</br>
  The implementation follows the C++98 standard.</br>
  The implementation works exactly as the original Containers.</br>

### ft::vector\<T\>
  is a data structure similar to the traditional array, except in that it has a dynamic size unlike arrays. In fact, the vector is implemented using an array, the array starts with an initial size, and whenever the array is full, the size is reallocated <code>(new size = old size + old size / 2)</code> in a new array and items are copied to the new reallocated memory.
